    myinfo:"I live in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I am pursuing my passion for computer science at the National University of La Plata, specifically at the Faculty of Computer Science (UNLP Inform√°tica). For more than two years, I have been dedicated to the development and study of software. I consider myself a passionate developer in constant growth and learning. My current goal is to be part of a team that gives me the opportunity to keep learning, collaborate with other professionals and establish a pleasant and stimulating work environment. My skills are focused on back-end development using languages such as Python and Java, along with their various tools. I have extensive knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP) and UML design, which allows me to create robust and efficient solutions. Throughout my journey in the programming world, I have worked with several programming languages, exploring both imperative and functional paradigms. This experience has given me a broad and versatile perspective, allowing me to approach challenges creatively and effectively. Outside of technology, I have a great passion for tennis and enjoy playing it very much. In addition, I value teamwork and consider that collaboration is fundamental to achieve successful results. My intuition and ability to work together allow me to easily adapt to different dynamics and contribute effectively to any project.",

    myinfo:"I live in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I am studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the National University of La Plata (UNLP), specifically at the School of Computer Science. For over three years, I have been dedicated to the development and study of software, and I have been working as a backend developer for the past eight months. I consider myself a passionate developer in constant growth and learning. \n My goal is to join a team that allows me to continue learning, collaborate with other professionals, and establish a pleasant and stimulating work environment. My skills focus on backend development using languages such as Python and Java, along with their various tools. I have extensive knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP) and UML design, which enables me to create robust and efficient solutions. \n Throughout my career, I have worked with several languages, exploring both imperative and functional paradigms. This experience has given me a broad and versatile perspective, allowing me to tackle challenges creatively and effectively. Outside of technology, I have a great passion for tennis and greatly enjoy playing it. I value teamwork and believe that collaboration is essential for achieving satisfactory results. My intuition and ability to work in a team allow me to adapt easily to different dynamics and contribute effectively to any project.",
